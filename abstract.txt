A Code Kata is a simple programming exercise, practiced repeatably by a developer.  Much like a musician practices scales and finger exercises to develop his musical skills, a developer will practice code katas to develop his programming skills.

This talk will be a live performance of a simple TDD-based code Kata, followed by an analysis of the forces and choices involved in the feedback loop between the code and the tests encountered during the kata. By examining this interaction of tests and code, we come to a better understanding of how to use tests to actively affect the direction of our design. By reflecting on the process, we understand how to pick "what to test next".

This talk is targeted for developers who have started using Test Driven Design (TDD) and feel that they don't quite "get it" yet, and are looking for guidance in the technique.
